This is a project attempting to make a version of a pong game.

test pong - a previous project where a picture bounces from left to right. This was a training exercise and the principles learned will help to make the next version

pong - a version of pong, to keep it within the realm of my ability the first version will have the following features:

1) the paddles and ball move at constant and same speed
2) the oppontent just moves up and down continuously (no advanced AI)
3) there is an single button for the player paddle that changes the direction
4) scoreboard
5) reinitialise the ball to a random location and direction angle toward the player paddle
